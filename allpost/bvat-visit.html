              experience-based information, knowledge, and training of value chain actors.</li>
            <li>To substantially increase share of quality organic products at local, national, regional, and
              international markets through value chain development and market strengthening; and</li>
            <li>To enhance structured management and governance of EOA through coordination, networking, advocacy, multi
              stakeholder platforms and capacity building leading to positive changes in agricultural systems in Africa
            </li>

          </ol>
          </p>
          <p>ROAM presentation to the BvAT team summed up the status of annual report 2021, challenges and remedial

            female and 41.1% male. The study showed that farmers lack information on farming technics, particularly
            mulching practices, and the study recommended EOA practices like mulching with mucuna for pineapple and
